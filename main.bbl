    Numerous studies have shown that neuronal responses are modulated by
  stimulus properties and also by the state of the local network. However,
  little is known about how activity fluctuations of neuronal populations
  modulate the sensory tuning of cells and affect their encoded information. We
  found that fluctuations in ongoing and stimulus-evoked population activity in
  primate visual cortex modulate the tuning of neurons in a multiplicative and
  additive manner. While distributed on a continuum, neurons with stronger
  multiplicative effects tended to have less additive modulation and vice
  versa. The information encoded by multiplicatively modulated neurons
  increased with greater population activity, while that of additively
  modulated neurons decreased. These effects offset each other so that
  population activity had little effect on total information. Our results thus
  suggest that intrinsic activity fluctuations may act as a "traffic light"
  that determines which subset of neurons is most informative.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The sources of ipsilateral cortical afferent projections to basoventral and
  mediodorsal prefrontal cortices that receive some visual input were studied
  with retrograde tracers (horseradish peroxidase or fluorescent dyes) in eight
  rhesus monkeys. The basoventral regions injected with tracers included basal
  (orbital) areas 11 and 12, lateral area 12, and ventral area 46. The
  mediodorsal regions included portions of medial area 32 and the caudal part
  of dorsal area 8. These sites represent areas within basoventral and
  mediodorsal prefrontal cortices that show a gradual increase in architectonic
  differentiation in a direction from the least differentiated orbital and
  medial limbic cortices toward the most differentiated cortices in the arcuate
  concavity. The results showed that the visual input to basoventral and
  mediodorsal prefrontal cortices originated largely in topographically
  distinct visual areas. Thus, basoventral sites received most of their visual
  cortical projections from the inferior temporal cortex. The rostral inferior
  temporal region was the predominant source of visual projections to orbital
  prefrontal sites, whereas lateral area 12 and ventral area 46 also received
  projections which were found more caudally. In contrast, mediodorsal
  prefrontal sites received most of their visual projections from dorsolateral
  and dorsomedial visual areas. The cells of origin were located in
  rostromedial visual cortices after injection of retrograde tracers in area 32
  and in more caudal medial and dorsolateral visual areas after injection in
  caudal area 8. The latter also received substantial projections from
  visuomotor regions in the caudal portion of the lateral bank of the
  intraparietal sulcus. These results suggest that the basoventral prefrontal
  cortices are connected with ventral visual areas implicated in pattern
  recognition and discrimination, whereas the mediodorsal cortices are
  connected with medial and dorsolateral occipital and parietal areas
  associated with visuospatial functions. In addition, the prefrontal areas
  studied received projections from auditory and/or somatosensory cortices,
  from areas associated with more than one modality, and from limbic regions.
  Orbital area 12 seemed to be a major target of projections from somatosensory
  cortices and the rostral portion of medial area 32 received substantial
  projections from auditory cortices. The least architectonically
  differentiated areas (orbital area 11 and medial area 32) had more widespread
  corticocortical connections, including strong links with limbic cortices. In
  contrast, areas which showed the highest degree of architectonic
  differentiation within the basoventral (area 46) and the mediodorsal (area 8)
  prefrontal cortices had restricted corticocortical connections. Copyright

    \field{abstract}{%
    The directionality of corticocortical projections is classified as
  feedforward (going from a lower to higher hierarchical levels), feedback
  (interconnecting descending levels), and lateral (interconnecting equivalent
  levels). Directionality is determined by the combined criteria of the laminar
  patterns of the axon terminals as well as the cells of origins and has been
  used to construct models of the visual system, which reveals a strict
  hierarchical organization (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991; Hilgetag et al.,
  1996a). However, these models are indeterminate partly because we have no
  indication of the distance separating adjacent levels. Here we have attempted
  to determine a graded parameter describing the anatomical relationship of
  interconnected areas. We have investigated whether the precise percentage of
  labeled supragranular layer neurons (SLN{\%}) in each afferent area after
  injection in either visual areas V1 or V4 determines its hierarchical
  position in the Felleman and Van Essen (1991) model. This shows that pathway
  directionality in the Felleman and Van Essen model is characterized by a
  range of SLN{\%} values. The one exception is the projection of the frontal
  eye field to area V4, which resembles a feedforward projection. Individual
  areal differences in SLN{\%} values are highly significant, and the number of
  hierarchical steps separating a target area from a source area is found to be
  tightly correlated to SLN{\%}. The present results show that the hierarchical
  rank of each afferent area is reliably indicated by SLN{\%}, and therefore
  this constitutes a graded parameter that is related to hierarchical
  distance.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The laminar organization of cortico-cortical projection neurons (expressed
  by the percentage of supragranular projecting neurons - SLN{\%})
  characterizes cortical pathways as feedforward (FF) or feedback (FB) and
  determines the hierarchical ranking of cortical areas. There is evidence of a
  developmental reduction in SLN{\%} of pathways to area V1. Here, by analyzing
  pre- and postnatal projections to area V4, we have been able to address
  whether developmental reductions of SLN{\%} impact on information processing
  in the immature cortex. FB pathways to area V4 exhibit 28-84{\%} reduction of
  SLN{\%}. This contrasts with the FF projections, which show little or no
  SLN{\%} reduction. However, SLN{\%} values in the immature cortex allocated
  cortical areas to the same hierarchical levels as in the adult. The
  developmental reduction of SLN{\%} is a widespread phenomenon in the
  neocortex and is a distinctive feature of FB pathways. Two mechanisms
  contribute to developmental changes in SLN{\%}: (i) delayed ingrowth of axons
  into the cortical target from infragranular layer neurons and (ii) prolonged
  developmental reduction of the divergence of projections from supragranular
  layer neurons. The present results show that FF and FB projections exhibit
  different developmental processes and patterns of connections linking
  cortical areas and their hierarchical relations are established prenatally,
  independently of regressive phenomena.%

    Although the role of cortical areas MT and MST (MT/MST) in the processing
  of directional motion information is well established, little is known about
  the way these areas contribute to the execution of complex behavioral tasks
  requiring the use of such information. We tested monkeys with unilateral
  lesions of these areas on a visual working memory task in which motion
  signals not only had to be encoded, but also stored for brief periods of time
  and then retrieved. The monkeys compared the directions of motion of two
  random-dot stimuli, sample and test, separated by a temporal delay. By
  increasing the temporal delay and spatially separating the two stimuli,
  placing one in the affected visual field and the other in the intact visual
  field, we were able to assess the contribution of MT/MST to specific
  components of the task: encoding (sample), retention (delay) and
  encoding/retrieval/comparison (test). We found that the effects of MT/MST
  lesions on specific components depended upon the demands of the task and the
  nature of the visual motion stimuli. Whenever stimuli consisted of random
  dots moving in a broad range of directions, MT/MST lesions appeared to affect
  encoding. Furthermore, when the lesions affected encoding of the sample,
  retention of the direction of stimulus motion was also affected. However,
  when the stimulus was coherent and the emphasis of the task was on the
  comparison of small direction differences, the absence of MT/MST had major
  impact on the retrieval/comparison component of the task and not on encoding
  or storage.%

    We applied electrical stimulation to physiologically identified sites in
  macaque middle temporal area (MT) to examine its role in short-term storage
  of recently encoded information about stimulus motion. We used a behavioral
  task in which monkeys compared the directions of two moving random-dot
  stimuli, sample and test, separated by a 1.5-s delay. Four sample directions
  were used for each site, and the animals had to indicate whether the
  direction of motion in the sample was the same as or different to the
  direction of motion in the test. We found that the effect of stimulation of
  the same directional column in MT depended on the behavioral state of the
  animal. Although stimulation had strong effects when applied during the
  encoding and the storage components of the task, these effects were not
  equivalent. Stimulation applied during the presentation of the sample
  produced signals interpreted by the monkeys as directional motion. However,
  the same stimulation introduced during the period of storage no longer
  produced signals interpreted as unambiguous directional information. We
  conclude that the directional information used by the monkeys in the working
  memory task is likely to be provided by neurons in MT, and the use of this
  information appears to be dependent on the portion of the task during which
  stimulation was delivered. Finally, the disruptive effects of stimulation
  during the delay suggest that MT neurons not only participate in the encoding
  of visual motion information but also in its storage by either maintaining an
  active connection with the circuitry involved in storage or being an integral
  component of that circuitry.%

    We recorded the activity of middle temporal (MT) neurons in 2 monkeys while
  they compared the directions of motion in 2 sequentially presented random-dot
  stimuli, sample and test, and reported them as the same or different by
  pressing one of 2 buttons. We found that MT neurons were active not only in
  response to the sample and test stimuli but also during the 1,500-ms delay
  separating them. Most neurons showed a characteristic pattern of activity
  consisting of a small burst of firing early in the delay, followed by a
  period of suppression and a subsequent increase in firing rate immediately
  preceding the presentation of the test stimulus. In a third of the neurons,
  the activity early in the delay not only reflected the direction of the
  sample stimulus, but was also related to the range of local directions it
  contained. During the middle of the delay the majority of neurons were
  suppressed, consistent with a gating mechanism that could be used to ignore
  task-irrelevant stimuli. Late in the delay, most neurons showed an increase
  in response, probably in anticipation of the upcoming test. Throughout most
  of the delay there was a directional signal in the population of MT neurons,
  manifested by higher firing rates following the sample moving in the
  antipreferred direction. Whereas some of these effects may be related to
  sensory adaptation, others are more likely to represent a more active
  task-related process. These results support the hypothesis that MT neurons
  actively participate in the successful execution of all aspects of the task
  requiring processing and remembering visual motion.%

    The small visual area known as MT or V5 has played a major role in our
  understanding of the primate cerebral cortex. This area has been historically
  important in the concept of cortical processing streams and the idea that
  different visual areas constitute highly specialized representations of
  visual information. MT has also proven to be a fertile culture dish-full of
  direction- and disparity-selective neurons-exploited by many labs to study
  the neural circuits underlying computations of motion and depth and to
  examine the relationship between neural activity and perception. Here we
  attempt a synthetic overview of the rich literature on MT with the goal of
  answering the question, What does MT do? Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 by

    We compared the ability of psychophysical observers and single cortical
  neurons to discriminate weak motion signals in a stochastic visual display.
  All data were obtained from rhesus monkeys trained to perform a direction
  discrimination task near psychophysical threshold. The conditions for such a
  comparison were ideal in that both psychophysical and physiological data were
  obtained in the same animals, on the same sets of trials, and using the same
  visual display. In addition, the psychophysical task was tailored in each
  experiment to the physiological properties of the neuron under study; the
  visual display was matched to each neuron's preference for size, speed, and
  direction of motion. Under these conditions, the sensitivity of most MT
  neurons was very similar to the psychophysical sensitivity of the animal
  observers. In fact, the responses of single neurons typically provided a
  satisfactory account of both absolute psychophysical threshold and the shape
  of the psychometric function relating performance to the strength of the
  motion signal. Thus, psychophysical decisions in our task are likely to be
  based upon a relatively small number of neural signals. These signals could
  be carried by a small number of neurons if the responses of the pooled
  neurons are statistically independent. Alternatively, the signals may be
  carried by a much larger pool of neurons if their responses are partially
  intercorrelated.%

    Neural responses are typically characterized by computing the mean firing
  rate, but response variability can exist across trials. Many studies have
  examined the effect of a stimulus on the mean response, but few have examined
  the effect on response variability. We measured neural variability in 13
  extracellularly recorded datasets and one intracellularly recorded dataset
  from seven areas spanning the four cortical lobes in monkeys and cats. In
  every case, stimulus onset caused a decline in neural variability. This
  occurred even when the stimulus produced little change in mean firing rate.
  The variability decline was observed in membrane potential recordings, in the
  spiking of individual neurons and in correlated spiking variability measured
  with implanted 96-electrode arrays. The variability decline was observed for
  all stimuli tested, regardless of whether the animal was awake, behaving or
  anaesthetized. This widespread variability decline suggests a rather general
  property of cortex, that its state is stabilized by an input.

    Visual attention improves perception for an attended location or feature
  and also modulates the responses of sensory neurons. In laboratory studies,
  the sensory stimuli and task instructions are held constant within an
  attentional condition, but despite experimenters' best efforts, attention
  likely varies from moment to moment. Because most previous studies have
  focused on single neurons, it has been impossible to use neuronal responses
  to identify attentional fluctuations and determine whether these are
  associated with changes in behavior. We show that an instantaneous measure of
  attention based on the responses of a modest number of neurons in area V4 of
  the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) can reliably predict large changes in an
  animal's ability to perform a difficult psychophysical task. Unexpectedly,
  this measure shows that the amount of attention allocated at any moment to
  locations in opposite hemifields is uncorrelated, suggesting that animals
  allocate attention to each stimulus independently rather than moving their
  attentional focus from one location to another.%

    Animals can flexibly change their behavior in response to a particular
  sensory stimulus; the mapping between sensory and motor representations in
  the brain must therefore be flexible as well. Changes in the correlated
  firing of pairs of neurons may provide a metric of changes in functional
  circuitry during behavior. We studied dynamic changes in functional circuitry
  by analyzing the noise correlations of simultaneously recorded MT neurons in
  two behavioral contexts: one that promotes cooperative interactions between
  the two neurons and another that promotes competitive interactions. We found
  that identical visual stimuli give rise to differences in noise correlation
  in the two contexts, suggesting that MT neurons receive inputs of central
  origin whose strength changes with the task structure. The data are
  consistent with a mixed feature-based attentional strategy model in which the
  animal sometimes alternates attention between opposite directions of motion
  and sometimes attends to the two directions simultaneously. {\textcopyright}

    Adaptive stimulus selection methods in neuroscience have primarily focused
  on maximizing the firing rate of a single recorded neuron. When recording
  from a population of neurons, it is usually not possible to find a single
  stimulus that maximizes the firing rates of all neurons. This motivates
  optimizing an objective function that takes into account the responses of all
  recorded neurons together. We propose " Adept, " an adaptive stimulus
  selection method that can optimize population objective functions. In
  simulations, we first confirmed that population objective functions elicited
  more diverse stimulus responses than single-neuron objective functions. Then,
  we tested Adept in a closed-loop electrophysiological experiment in which
  population activity was recorded from macaque V4, a cortical area known for
  mid-level visual processing. To predict neural responses, we used the outputs
  of a deep convolutional neural network model as feature embeddings. Images
  chosen by Adept elicited mean neural responses that were 20{\%} larger than
  those for randomly-chosen natural images, and also evoked a larger diversity
  of neural responses. Such adaptive stimulus selection methods can facilitate
  experiments that involve neurons far from the sensory periphery, for which it
  is often unclear which stimuli to present.%

    Variability in neuronal responses to identical stimuli is frequently
  correlated across a population. Attention is thought to reduce these
  correlations by suppressing noisy inputs shared by the population. However,
  even with precise control of the visual stimulus, the subject's attentional
  state varies across trials. While these state fluctuations are bound to
  induce some degree of correlated variability, it is currently unknown how
  strong their effect is, as previous studies generally do not dissociate
  changes in attentional strength from changes in attentional state
  variability. We designed a novel paradigm that does so and find both a
  pronounced effect of attentional fluctuations on correlated variability at
  long timescales and attention-dependent reductions in correlations at short
  timescales. These effects predominate in layers 2/3, as expected from a
  feedback signal such as attention. Thus, significant portions of correlated
  variability can be attributed to fluctuations in internally generated
  signals, like attention, rather than noise.%

    The prefronto-striatal network is involved in many cognitive functions,
  including perceptual decision making and reward-modulated behaviors. For
  well-trained subjects, neural responses frequently show similar patterns in
  the prefrontal cortex and striatum, making it difficult to tease apart
  distinct regional contributions. Here I show that, despite similar mean
  firing rate patterns, prefrontal and striatal responses differ in other
  temporal dynamics for both perceptual and reward-based tasks. Compared with
  simulation results, the temporal dynamics of prefrontal activity are
  consistent with an accumulation of sensory evidence used to solve a
  perceptual task but not with an accumulation of reward context-related
  information used for the development of a reward bias. In contrast, the
  dynamics of striatal activity is consistent with an accumulation of reward
  context-related information and with an accumulation of sensory evidence
  during early stimulus viewing. These results suggest that prefrontal and
  striatal neurons may have specialized functions for different tasks even with
  similar average activity.%

    Attention is commonly thought to improve behavioral performance by
  increasing response gain and suppressing shared variability in neuronal
  populations. However, both the focus and the strength of attention are likely
  to vary from one experimental trial to the next, thereby inducing response
  variability unknown to the experimenter. Here we study analytically how
  fluctuations in attentional state affect the structure of population
  responses in a simple model of spatial and feature attention. In our model,
  attention acts on the neural response exclusively by modulating each neuron's
  gain. Neurons are conditionally independent given the stimulus and the
  attentional gain, and correlated activity arises only from trial-to-trial
  fluctuations of the attentional state, which are unknown to the experimenter.
  We find that this simple model can readily explain many aspects of neural
  response modulation under attention, such as increased response gain, reduced
  individual and shared variability, increased correlations with firing rates,
  limited range correlations, and differential correlations. We therefore
  suggest that attention may act primarily by increasing response gain of
  individual neurons without affecting their correlation structure. The
  experimentally observed reduction in correlations may instead result from
  reduced variability of the attentional gain when a stimulus is attended.
  Moreover, we show that attentional gain fluctuations, even if unknown to a
  downstream readout, do not impair the readout accuracy despite inducing
  limited-range correlations, whereas fluctuations of the attended feature can
  in principle limit behavioral performance.%

    In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the
  macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between areas has
  increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of the
  layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities,
  (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of
  information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data
  to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our
  analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical
  areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an
  additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of
  their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32
  visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31X
  of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all
  others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40{\%}.
  The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas.
  There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual
  system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical,
  transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In
  the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13
  cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40{\%}. Based on
  the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of
  visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than
  those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual
  hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains
  14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the
  bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within
  this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at
  a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas VI and V2
  and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing
  centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways
  and relationships (about 10{\%} of the total) whose descriptions do not fit
  cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most
  instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions
  to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainties in the
  reported assignment. {\textcopyright} 1991 Oxford University Press.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The modular organization of cortical pathways linking visual area 4 (V4)
  with occipital visual area 2 (V2) and inferotemporal posterior inferotemporal
  ventral area (PITv) was investigated through an analysis of the patterns of
  retrogradely labeled cell bodies after injections of tracers into V4 and
  PITv. Although cytochrome oxidase or other stains have failed to yield
  reliable independent anatomical markers for cortical modules beyond V1 and
  V2, V4 and PITv seem to have modular compartments with specific patterns of
  cortico-cortical connectivity. Tracer injections of V4 labeled cells in V2
  (1) thin stripes exclusively, (2) interstripes exclusively, or (3) specific
  combinations of interstripe and thin stripe subcompartments. These labeling
  patterns suggest (1) that there is a complicated organization of inputs to
  V4, (2) that projections from V2 to V4 display a submodular selectivity, and
  (3) that projections from V2 to V4 display some degree of cross-stream
  convergence. Consistent with this framework, extensive regions of PITv
  provide feedback projections to interstripe-recipient portions of V4, whereas
  more restricted portions of PITv provide feedback to thin stripe-recipient
  portions of V4. Similarly, the feedforward projection from V4 to PITy often
  arose from multiple cell clusters across a wide expanse of V4. When
  distinguishable fluorescent tracers were injected into two PITv sites
  separated by 3-5 mm, a variety of projection patterns was observed in V4. In
  moat cases, labeled cells were found in multiple, interdigitating,
  nonoverlapping clusters of 1-3 mm width, whereas in other cases the two
  labeled fields were highly intermixed. These results suggest that V4 and PITv
  contain functional modules that can be characterized by the specific patterns
  of segregated and convergent projections they receive from lower cortical
  areas. These specific patterns of intercortical input, in conjunction with
  intrinsic cortical circuitry, may endow extrastriate cortical neurons with
  new and more complex receptive field properties.%

    To understand a neural circuit requires knowledge of its connectivity. Here
  we report measurements of functional connectivity between the input and ouput
  layers of the macaque retina at single-cell resolution and the implications
  of these for colour vision. Multi-electrode technology was used to record
  simultaneously from complete populations of the retinal ganglion cell types
  (midget, parasol and small bistratified) that transmit high-resolution visual
  signals to the brain. Fine-grained visual stimulation was used to identify
  the location, type and strength of the functional input of each cone
  photoreceptor to each ganglion cell. The populations of ON and OFF midget and
  parasol cells each sampled the complete population of long- and
  middle-wavelength-sensitive cones. However, only OFF midget cells frequently
  received strong input from short-wavelength-sensitive cones. ON and OFF
  midget cells showed a small non-random tendency to selectively sample from
  either long- or middle-wavelength-sensitive cones to a degree not explained
  by clumping in the cone mosaic. These measurements reveal computations in a
  neural circuit at the elementary resolution of individual neurons.

    Re-entrant or feedback pathways between cortical areas carry rich and
  varied information about behavioural context, including attention,
  expectation, perceptual tasks, working memory and motor commands. Neurons
  receiving such inputs effectively function as adaptive processors that are
  able to assume different functional states according to the task being
  executed. Recent data suggest that the selection of particular inputs,
  representing different components of an association field, enable neurons to
  take on different functional roles. In this Review, we discuss the various
  top-down influences exerted on the visual cortical pathways and highlight the
  dynamic nature of the receptive field, which allows neurons to carry
  information that is relevant to the current perceptual demands.

    Although neuronal synchronization has been shown to exist in primary motor
  cortex (MI), very little is known about its possible contribution to coding
  of movement. By using cross-correlation techniques from multi-neuron
  recordings in MI, we observed that activity of neurons commonly synchronized
  around the time of movement initiation. For some cell pairs, synchrony varied
  with direction in a manner not readily predicted by the firing of either
  neuron. Information theoretic analysis demonstrated quantitatively that
  synchrony provides information about movement direction beyond that expected
  by simple rate changes. Thus, MI neurons are not simply independent encoders
  of movement parameters but rather engage in mutual interactions that could
  potentially provide an additional coding dimension in cortex.%

    Electrophysiological recordings were obtained from cells in areas 17, 18
  and 19 of the cat visual cortex. Light stimuli were presented to the intact
  eyes. Cells were characterized as complex and hypercomplex, depending on
  whether they responded best to single lines or edges extending over their
  whole receptive field, or whether the feature proved to be effective in
  activating the cell when in only a portion of the field. Hypercomplex cells
  predominated in area 19. Many interesting observations about cell responses
  are reported in this paper, including findings about the columnar arrangement
  of cells, binocular driving of cells, and size and location of their
  receptive fields. Histological and physiological studies agree on the
  delineation of the borders between areas 17 and 18, and areas 18 and 19.
  Silver-degeneration experiments show that cells in area 17 project to areas

    During motion discrimination tasks, many prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons
  are strongly modulated by the behavioral context, suggesting their
  involvement in sensory discriminations. Recent studies suggest that
  trial-to-trial variability of spiking activity characteristic of cortical
  neurons could be a source of information about the state of neuronsand their
  participation in behavioral tasks.Wetested this hypothesis by examining the
  variability of putative pyramidal PFC neurons, a likely source of top-down
  influences. The variability of these neurons was calculated as a ratio of
  spike count variance to its mean (fano factor, FF), while monkeys compared
  the directions of two moving stimuli, sample and test, separated by a delay.
  We found that the FF tracked consecutive components of the task, dropping
  rapidly with the onset of stimuli being discriminated and declining more
  slowly before each salient event of the trial: The sample, the test, and the
  response. These time-dependent signals were less consistent in direction
  selective neurons and were largely absent during passive fixation.
  Furthermore, neurons with test responses that reflected the remembered sample
  decreased their FF well before the test, revealing the predictive nature of
  response variability, an effect present only during the active task. The FF

    Discrimination tasks require processing, interpreting, and linking sensory
  information to the appropriate motor response. We report that neurons in
  prefrontal cortex (PFC) represent visual motion with precision comparable to
  cortical neurons at early stages of motion processing, and readily adapt this
  representation to behavioral context. We found that direction selectivity,
  recorded while the monkeys discriminated directions, decreased when they
  judged motion speed and ignored its direction. This decrease was more
  pronounced in neurons classified as narrow-spiking (NS) putative interneurons
  than in broad-spiking (BS) putative pyramidal neurons. However, during
  passive fixation, when the link between motion and its behavioral relevance
  was removed, both cell types showed a severe selectivity loss. Our results
  show that flexible sensory representation during active discrimination tasks
  is achieved in the PFC by a specialized neuronal network of both NS neurons
  readily adjusting their selectivity to behavioral context, and BS neurons
  capable of maintaining relatively stable sensory representation.

    Comparing two stimuli that occur at different times demands the
  coordination of bottom-up and top-down processes. It has been hypothesized
  that the dorsolateral prefrontal (PFC) cortex, the likely source of top-down
  cortical influences, plays a key role in such tasks, contributing to both
  maintenance and sensory comparisons. We examined this hypothesis by recording
  from the PFC of monkeys comparing directions of two moving stimuli, S1 and
  S2, separated by a memory delay. We determined the contribution of the two
  principal cell types to these processes by classifying neurons into
  broad-spiking (BS) putative pyramidal cells and narrow-spiking (NS) putative
  local interneurons. During the delay, BS cells were more likely to exhibit
  anticipatory modulation and represent the remembered direction. While this
  representation was transient, appearing at different times in different
  neurons, it weakened when direction was not task relevant, suggesting its
  utility. During S2, both putative cell types showed comparison-related
  activity modulations. These modulations were of two types, each carried by
  different neurons, which either preferred trials with stimuli moving in the
  same direction or trials with stimuli of different directions. These
  comparison effects were strongly correlated with choice, suggesting their
  role in circuitry underlying decision making. These results provide the first
  demonstration of distinct contributions made by principal cell types to
  memory-guided perceptual decisions. During sensory stimulation both cell
  types represent behaviorally relevant stimulus features contributing to
  comparison and decision-related activity. However in the absence of sensory
  stimulation, putative pyramidal cells dominated, carrying information about
  the elapsed time and the preceding direction. {\textcopyright} 2012 the

    When a monkey needs to decide whether motion direction of one stimulus is
  the same or different as that of another held in working memory, neurons in
  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) faithfully represent the motion
  directions being evaluated and contribute to their comparison. Here, we
  examined whether DLPFC neurons are more generally involved in other types of
  sensory comparisons. Such involvement would support the existence of
  generalized sensory comparison mechanisms within DLPFC, shedding light on
  top-down influences this region is likely to provide to the upstream sensory
  neurons during comparison tasks. We recorded activity of individual neurons
  in the DLPFC while monkeys performed a memory-guided decision task in which
  the important dimension was the speed of two sequentially presented moving
  random-dot stimuli. We found that many neurons, both narrow-spiking putative
  local interneurons and broad-spiking putative pyramidal output cells, were
  speed-selective, with tuning reminiscent of that observed in the motion
  processing middle temporal (MT) cortical area. Throughout the delay,
  broad-spiking neurons were more active, showing anticipatory rate modulation
  and transient periods of speed selectivity. During the comparison stimulus,
  responses of both cell types were modulated by the speed of the first
  stimulus, and their activity was highly predictive of the animals' behavioral
  report. These results are similar to those found for comparisons of motion
  direction, suggesting the existence of generalized neural mechanisms in the
  DLPFC subserving the comparison of sensory signals. {\textcopyright} 2013 the

    We propose an alternative generator architecture for generative adversarial

  stochastic variation in the generated images (e.g., freckles, hair), and it
  enables intuitive, scale-specific control of the synthesis. The new generator
  improves the state-of-the-art in terms of traditional distribution quality

  better disentangles the latent factors of variation. To quantify
  interpolation quality and disentanglement, we propose two new, automated

    During decision making, neurons in multiple brain regions exhibit responses
  that are correlated with decisions. However, it remains uncertain whether or
  not various forms of decision-related activity are causally related to
  decision making. Here we address this question by recording and reversibly
  inactivating the lateral intraparietal (LIP) and middle temporal (MT) areas
  of rhesus macaques performing a motion direction discrimination task. Neurons
  in area LIP exhibited firing rate patterns that directly resembled the
  evidence accumulation process posited to govern decision making, with strong
  correlations between their response fluctuations and the animal's choices.
  Neurons in area MT, in contrast, exhibited weak correlations between their
  response fluctuations and choices, and had firing rate patterns consistent
  with their sensory role in motion encoding. The behavioural impact of
  pharmacological inactivation of each area was inversely related to their
  degree of decision-related activity: while inactivation of neurons in MT
  profoundly impaired psychophysical performance, inactivation in LIP had no
  measurable impact on decision-making performance, despite having silenced the
  very clusters that exhibited strong decision-related activity. Although LIP
  inactivation did not impair psychophysical behaviour, it did influence
  spatial selection and oculomotor metrics in a free-choice control task. The
  absence of an effect on perceptual decision making was stable over trials and
  sessions and was robust to changes in stimulus type and task geometry,
  arguing against several forms of compensation. Thus, decision-related signals
  in LIP do not appear to be critical for computing perceptual decisions, and
  may instead reflect secondary processes. Our findings highlight a
  dissociation between decision correlation and causation, showing that strong
  neuron-decision correlations do not necessarily offer direct access to the
  neural computations underlying decisions.%

    The responsivity of primary sensory cortical neurons is reduced following
  prolonged adaptation, but such adaptation has been little studied in higher

  we studied the effect of prolonged stimulation on neuronal responsivity in
  the macaque's area MT, a cortical area whose importance to visual motion
  perception is well established. We adapted MT neurons with sinusoidal
  gratings drifting in the preferred or null direction. Preferred adaptation
  reduced the responsiveness of MT cells, primarily by changing their contrast
  gain, and this effect was spatially specific within the receptive field. Null
  adaptation reduced the ability of null gratings to inhibit the response to a
  simultaneously presented preferred stimulus. While both preferred and null
  adaptation alter MT responses, these effects probably do not occur in MT

    A central goal of neuroscience is to understand the representations formed
  by brain activity patterns and their connection to behaviour. The classic
  approach is to investigate how individual neurons encode stimuli and how
  their tuning determines the fidelity of the neural representation. Tuning
  analyses often use the Fisher information to characterize the sensitivity of
  neural responses to small changes of the stimulus. In recent decades,
  measurements of large populations of neurons have motivated a complementary
  approach, which focuses on the information available to linear decoders. The
  decodable information is captured by the geometry of the representational
  patterns in the multivariate response space. Here we review neural tuning and
  representational geometry with the goal of clarifying the relationship
  between them. The tuning induces the geometry, but different sets of tuned
  neurons can induce the same geometry. The geometry determines the Fisher
  information, the mutual information and the behavioural performance of an
  ideal observer in a range of psychophysical tasks. We argue that future
  studies can benefit from considering both tuning and geometry to understand
  neural codes and reveal the connections between stimuli, brain activity and
  behaviour.%

    We measured the responses of 305 neurons in striate cortex to moving
  sinusoidal gratings modulated in chromaticity and luminance about a fixed
  white point. Stimuli were represented in a 3-dimensional color space defined
  by 2 chromatic axes and a third along which luminance varied. With rare
  exceptions the chromatic properties of cortical neurons were well described
  by a linear model in which the response of a cell is proportional to the sum
  (for complex cells, the rectified sum) of the signals from the 3 classes of
  cones. For each cell there is a vector passing through the white point along
  which modulation gives rise to a maximal response. The elevation
  ($\theta$(m)) and azimuth ($\phi$(m)) of this vector fully describe the
  chromatic properties of the cell. The linear model also describes neurons in
  l.g.n. (Derrington et al., 1984), so most neurons in striate cortex have the
  same chromatic selectivity as do neurons in l.g.n. However, the distributions
  of preferred vectors differed in cortex and l.g.n.: Most cortical neurons
  preferred modulation along vectors lying close to the achromatic axis and
  those showing overt chromatic opponency did not fall into the clearly defined
  chromatic groups seen in l.g.n. The neurons most responsive to chromatic
  modulation (found mainly in layers IVA, IVC$\beta$, and VI) had poor
  orientation selectivity, and responded to chromatic modulation of a spatially
  uniform field at least as well as they did to any grating. We encountered
  neurons with band-pass spatial selectivity for chromatically modulated
  stimuli in layers II/III and VI. Most had complex receptive fields. Neurons
  in layer II/III did not fall into distinct groups according to their
  chromatic sensitivities, and the chromatic properties of neurons known to lie
  within regions rich in cytochrome oxidase appeared no different from those of
  neurons in the interstices. Six neurons, all of which resembled simple cells,
  showed unusually sharp chromatic selectivity.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Many neurons in extrastriate visual cortex have large receptive fields, and
  this may lead to significant computational problems whenever multiple stimuli
  fall within a single field. Previous studies have suggested that when
  multiple stimuli fall within a cell's receptive field, they compete for the
  cell's response in a manner that can be biased in favor of attended stimuli.
  In the present study we examined this role of attention in areas V1, V2, and
  V4 of macaque monkeys with the use of a behavioral paradigm in which
  attention was directed to one of two stimulus locations. When two stimuli
  were presented simultaneously inside the cell's receptive field I which could
  be accomplished only in areas V2 and V4), we found that the cell's response
  was strongly influenced by which of the two stimuli was attended. The size of
  this attention effect was reduced when the attended and ignored stimuli were
  presented sequentially rather than simultaneously. In addition, the effects
  became very weak and inconsistent in these areas when only one of the two
  stimuli was located inside the receptive field. Attention thus modulated
  sensory responses primarily when two or more simultaneous stimuli competed
  for access to a neuron's receptive field. As in areas V2 and V4, attention
  did not modulate sensory responses in area V1 when only a single stimulus was
  inside the receptive field. In addition, the small receptive fields in this
  area precluded the simultaneous presentation of attended and ignored stimuli
  inside the receptive field, making it impossible to determine whether
  attention effects would be observed under the conditions that led to
  consistent attention effects in areas V2 and V4. Spontaneous firing rates in
  areas V2 and V4 were found to be 30-40{\%} higher when attention was directed
  inside rather than outside the receptive field, even when no stimulus was
  present in the receptive field. Spontaneous firing rates also varied
  according to the particular location within the receptive field that was
  attended. These shifts in spontaneous activity may reflect a top-down signal
  that biases responses in favor of stimuli at the attended location.%

    Visually guided behavior often involves decisions that are based on
  evaluating stimuli in the context of those observed previously. Such
  decisions are made by monkeys comparing two consecutive stimuli, sample and
  test, moving in the same or opposite directions. We examined whether
  responses in the motion processing area MT during the comparison phase of
  this task (test) are modulated by the direction of the preceding stimulus
  (sample). This modulation, termed comparison signal, was measured by
  comparing responses to identical test stimuli on trials when it was preceded
  by sample moving in the same direction (S-trials) with trials when it was
  preceded by sample moving in a different direction (D-trials). The test
  always appeared in the neuron's receptive field (RF), whereas sample could
  appear in the RF or in the contralateral visual field (remote sample). With
  sample in-RF, we found three types of modulation carried by different sets of
  neurons: early suppression on S-trials and late enhancement, one on S-trials,
  and the other on D-trials. Under these conditions, many neurons with and
  without comparison effects exhibited significant, choice-related activity.
  Response modulation was also present following the remote sample, even though
  the information about its direction could only reach MT indirectly via
  top-down influences. However, unlike on trials with in-RF sample, these
  signals were dominated by response suppression, shedding light on the
  contribution of top-down influences to the comparison effects. These results
  demonstrate that during the task requiring monkeys to compare two directions
  of motion, MT responses during the comparison phase of this task reflect
  similarities and differences between the two stimuli, suggesting
  participation in sensory comparisons. The nature of these signals provides
  insights into the operation of bottom-up and top-down influences involved in
  this process. {\textcopyright} 2011 the American Physiological Society.%

    The cortex contains multiple cell types, but studies of attention have not
  distinguished between them, limiting understanding of the local circuits that
  transform attentional feedback into improved visual processing.
  Parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons can be distinguished from
  pyramidal neurons based on their briefer action potential durations. We
  recorded neurons in area V4 as monkeys performed an attention-demanding task.
  We find that the distribution of action potential durations is strongly
  bimodal. Neurons with narrow action potentials have higher firing rates and
  larger attention-dependent increases in absolute firing rate than neurons
  with broad action potentials. The percentage increase in response is similar
  across the two classes. We also find evidence that attention increases the
  reliability of the neuronal response. This modulation is more than two-fold
  stronger among putative interneurons. These findings lead to the surprising
  conclusion that the strongest attentional modulation occurs among local
  interneurons that do not transmit signals between areas. {\textcopyright}

    Computational strategies used by the brain strongly depend on the amount of
  information that can be stored in population activity, which in turn strongly
  depends on the pattern of noise correlations. In vivo, noise correlations
  tend to be positive and proportional to the similarity in tuning properties.
  Such correlations are thought to limit information, which has led to the
  suggestion that decorrelation increases information. In contrast, we found,
  analytically and numerically, that decorrelation does not imply an increase
  in information. Instead, the only information-limiting correlations are what
  we refer to as differential correlations: correlations proportional to the
  product of the derivatives of the tuning curves. Unfortunately, differential
  correlations are likely to be very small and buried under correlations that
  do not limit information, making them particularly difficult to detect. We
  found, however, that the effect of differential correlations on information
  can be detected with relatively simple decoders.%

    A fundamental feature of the mammalian cortex is to guide movements in
  time. One common pattern of neural activity observed across cortical regions
  during temporal control of action is ramping activity. Ramping activity can
  be defined as consistent increases or decreases in neuronal firing rate
  across behaviorally relevant epochs of time. Prefrontal brain regions,
  including medial frontal and lateral prefrontal cortex, are critical for
  temporal control of action. Ramping is among the most common pattern of
  neural activity in these prefrontal areas during behavioral tasks. Finally,
  stimulating prefrontal neurons in medial frontal cortex can influence the
  timing of movement. These data can be helpful in approaching human diseases
  with impaired temporal of action, such as Parkinson's disease and
  schizophrenia. Cortical ramping activity might contribute to new diagnostic
  and therapeutic strategies for these and other debilitating human diseases.%

    State space methods have proven indispensable in neural data analysis.
  However, common methods for performing inference in state-space models with
  non-Gaussian observations rely on certain approximations which are not always
  accurate. Here we review direct optimization methods that avoid these
  approximations, but that nonetheless retain the computational efficiency of
  the approximate methods. We discuss a variety of examples, applying these
  direct optimization techniques to problems in spike train smoothing, stimulus
  decoding, parameter estimation, and inference of synaptic properties. Along
  the way, we point out connections to some related standard statistical
  methods, including spline smoothing and isotonic regression. Finally, we note
  that the computational methods reviewed here do not in fact depend on the
  state-space setting at all; instead, the key property we are exploiting
  involves the bandedness of certain matrices. We close by discussing some
  applications of this more general point of view, including Markov chain Monte
  Carlo methods for neural decoding and efficient estimation of
  spatially-varying firing rates.%

    Psychophysical and neurophysiological studies of responses to visual motion
  have converged on a consistent set of general principles that characterize
  visual processing of motion information. Both types of approaches have shown
  that the direction and speed of target motion are among the most important
  encoded stimulus properties, revealing many parallels between psychophysical
  and physiological responses to motion. Motivated by these parallels, this
  review focuses largely on more direct links between the key feature of the
  neuronal response to motion, direction selectivity, and its utilization in
  memory-guided perceptual decisions. These links were established during
  neuronal recordings in monkeys performing direction discriminations, but also
  by examining perceptual effects of widespread elimination of cortical
  direction selectivity produced by motion deprivation during development.
  Other approaches, such as microstimulation and lesions, have documented the
  importance of direction-selective activity in the areas that are active
  during memory-guided direction comparisons, area MT and the prefrontal
  cortex, revealing their likely interactions during behavioral tasks.%

    Shape is represented in the visual system by patterns of activity across
  populations of neurons. We studied the population code for shape in area V4
  of macaque monkeys, which is part of the ventral (object-related) pathway in
  primate visual cortex. We have previously found that many macaque V4 neurons
  are tuned for the curvature and object-centered position of boundary
  fragments (such as 'concavity on the right'). Here we tested the hypothesis
  that populations of such cells represent complete shapes as aggregates of
  boundary fragments. To estimate the population representation of a given
  shape, we scaled each cell's tuning peak by its response to that shape,
  summed across cells and smoothed. The resulting population response surface
  contained 3-8 peaks that represented major boundary features and could be
  used to reconstruct (approximately) the original shape. This exemplifies how
  a multi-peaked neural population response can represent a complex stimulus in
  terms of its constituent elements.%

    What specific features should visual neurons encode, given the infinity of
  real-world images and the limited number of neurons available to represent
  them? We investigated neuronal selectivity in monkey inferotemporal cortex
  via the vast hypothesis space of a generative deep neural network, avoiding
  assumptions about features or semantic categories. A genetic algorithm
  searched this space for stimuli that maximized neuronal firing. This led to
  the evolution of rich synthetic images of objects with complex combinations
  of shapes, colors, and textures, sometimes resembling animals or familiar
  people, other times revealing novel patterns that did not map to any clear
  semantic category. These results expand our conception of the dictionary of
  features encoded in the cortex, and the approach can potentially reveal the
  internal representations of any system whose input can be captured by a
  generative model. Neurons guided the evolution of their own best stimuli with
  a generative deep neural network.%

    Population codes assume that neural systems represent sensory inputs
  through the firing rates of populations of differently tuned neurons.
  However, trial-by-trial variability and noise correlations are known to
  affect the information capacity of neural codes. Although recent studies have
  shown that stimulus presentation reduces both variability and rate
  correlations with respect to their spontaneous level, possibly improving the
  encoding accuracy, whether these second order statistics are tuned is
  unknown. If so, second-order statistics could themselves carry information,
  rather than being invariably detrimental. Here we show that rate variability
  and noise correlation vary systematically with stimulus direction in
  directionally selective middle temporal (MT) neurons, leading to
  characteristic tuning curves. We show that such tuning emerges in a
  stochastic recurrent network, for a set of connectivity parameters that
  overlaps with a single-state scenario and multistability. Information
  theoretic analysis shows that second-order statistics carry information that
  can improve the accuracy of the population code.%

    To a large extent, progress in neuroscience has been driven by the study of
  single-cell responses averaged over several repetitions of stimuli or
  behaviours. However,the brain typically makes decisions based on single
  events by evaluating the activity of large neuronal populations. Therefore,
  to further understand how the brain processes information, it is important to
  shift from a single-neuron, multiple-trial framework to multiple-neuron,
  single-trial methodologies. Two related approaches - decoding and information
  theory - can be used to extract single-trial information from the activity of
  neuronal populations. Such population analysis can give us more information
  about how neurons encode stimulus features than traditional single-cell
  studies. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights

    A novel measure of neural spike train randomness, an entropy factor, is
  proposed. It is based on the Shannon entropy of the number of spikes in a
  time window and can be seen as an analogy to the Fano factor. Theoretical
  properties of the new measure are studied for equilibrium renewal processes
  and further illustrated on gamma and inverse Gaussian probability
  distributions of interspike intervals. Finally, the entropy factor is
  evaluated from the experimental records of spontaneous activity in macaque
  primary visual cortex and compared to its theoretical behavior deduced for
  the renewal process models. Both theoretical and experimental results show
  substantial differences between the Fano and entropy factors. Rather
  paradoxically, an increase in the variability of spike count is often
  accompanied by an increase of its predictability, as evidenced by the entropy
  factor.%

    Neural activity and behavior in laboratory experiments are surprisingly
  variable across trials. This variability and its potential causes have been
  the focus of a spirited debate. Here we review recent research that has shed
  light on the sources of neural variability and its impact on behavior. We
  explain how variability may arise from incomplete knowledge about an animal's
  internal states and its environment. We discuss the problem of incomplete
  knowledge both from the experimenter's point of view and from the animal's
  point of view. Both view points are illustrated through several examples from
  the literature. We furthermore consider both mechanistic and normative models
  that explain how neural and behavioral variability may be linked. Finally, we
  review why variability may confer an adaptive advantage to organisms.

    We examined the nature and the selectivity of the motion deficits produced
  by lesions of extrastriate areas MT and MST. Lesions were made by injecting
  ibotenic acid into the representation of the left visual field in two macaque
  monkeys. The monkeys discriminated two stimuli that differed either in
  stimulus direction or orientation. Direction and orientation discrimination
  were assessed by measuring thresholds with gratings and random-dots placed in
  the intact or lesioned visual fields. At the start of behavioral testing, we
  found pronounced, motion-specific deficits in thresholds for all types of
  moving stimuli, including pronounced elevations in contrast thresholds and in
  signal-to-noise thresholds measured with moving gratings, as well as deficits
  in direction range thresholds and motion coherence measured with random-dot
  stimuli. In addition, the accuracy of direction discrimination was reduced at
  smaller spatial displacements (i.e. step sizes), suggesting an increase in
  spatial scale of the residual directional mechanism. Subsequent improvements
  in thresholds were seen with all motion stimuli, as behavioral training
  progressed, and these improvements occurred only with extensive behavioral
  testing in the lesioned visual field. These improvements were particularly
  pronounced for stimuli not masked by noise. On the other hand, deficits in
  the ability to extract motion from noisy stimuli and in the accuracy of
  direction discrimination persisted despite extensive behavioral training.
  These results demonstrate the importance of areas MT and MST for the
  perception of motion direction, particularly in the presence of noise. In
  addition, they provide evidence for the importance of behavioral training for
  functional recovery after cortical lesions. The data also strongly support
  the idea of functional specialization of areas MT and MST for motion
  processing.%

    Physiological and behavioral evidence suggests that the activity of
  direction selective neurons in visual cortex underlies the perception of
  moving visual stimuli. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the effects of
  cortical microstimulation on perceptual judgements of motion direction. To
  accomplish this, rhesus monkeys were trained to discriminate the direction of
  motion in a near-threshold, stochastic motion display. For each experiment,
  we positioned a microelectrode in the middle of a cluster of neurons that
  shared a common preferred direction of motion. The psychophysical task was
  then adjusted so that the visual display was presented directly over the
  neurons' receptive field. The monkeys were required to discriminate between
  motion shown either in the direction preferred by the neurons or in the
  opposite direction. On half the trials of an experiment, we applied
  electrical microstimulation while monkeys viewed the motion display. We
  hypothesized that enhancing the neurons' discharge rate would introduce a
  directionally specific signal into the cortex and thereby influence the
  monkeys' choices on the discrimination task. We compared the monkeys'
  performance on 'stimulated' and 'nonstimulated' trials in 139 experiments;
  all trials within an experiment were presented in random order. Statistically
  significant effects of microstimulation were obtained in 89 experiments. In
  86 of the 89 experiments with significant effects (97{\%}), the monkeys
  indicated that motion was in the neurons' preferred direction more frequently
  on stimulated trials than on nonstimulated trials. The data demonstrate a
  functional link between the activity of direction selective neurons and
  perceptual judgements of motion direction.%

    NEURONS in the visual cortex respond selectively to perceptually salient
  features of the visual scene, such as the direction and speed of moving
  objects, the orientation of local contours, or the colour or relative depth
  of a visual pattern. It is commonly assumed that the brain constructs its
  percept of the visual scene from information encoded in the selective
  responses of such neurons. We have now tested this hypothesis directly by
  measuring the effect on psychophysical performance of modifying the firing
  rates of physiologically characterized neurons. We required rhesus monkeys to
  report the direction of motion in a visual display while we electrically
  stimulated clusters of directionally selective neurons in the middle temporal
  visual area (MT, or V5), an extrastriate area that plays a prominent role in
  the analysis of visual motion information 1-8 . Microstimulation biased the
  animals' judgements towards the direction of motion encoded by the stimulated
  neurons. This result indicates that physiological properties measured at the
  neuronal level can be causally related to a specific aspect of perceptual
  performance. {\textcopyright} 1990 Nature Publishing Group.%

    Several studies have shown that the information conveyed by bell-shaped
  tuning curves increases as their width decreases, leading to the notion that
  sharpening of tuning curves improves population codes. This notion, however,
  is based on assumptions that the noise distribution is independent among
  neurons and independent of the tuning curve width. Here we reexamine these
  assumptions in networks of spiking neurons by using orientation selectivity
  as an example. We compare two principal classes of model: one in which the
  tuning curves are sharpened through cortical lateral interactions, and one in
  which they are not. We report that sharpening through lateral interactions
  does not improve population codes but, on the contrary, leads to a severe
  loss of information. In addition, the sharpening models generate complicated
  codes that rely extensively on pairwise correlations. Our study generates
  several experimental predictions that can be used to distinguish between
  these two classes of model.%

  Decision in the Parietal Cortex (Area LIP) of the Rhesus Monkey. J.
  Neurophysiol. 86: 1916-1936, 2001. We recorded the activity of single neurons
  in the posterior parietal cortex (area LIP) of two rhesus monkeys while they
  discriminated the direction of motion in random-dot visual stimuli. The
  visual task was similar to a motion discrimination task that has been used in
  previous investigations of motion-sensitive regions of the extrastriate
  cortex. The monkeys were trained to decide whether the direction of motion
  was toward one of two choice targets that appeared on either side of the
  random-dot stimulus. At the end of the trial, the monkeys reported their
  direction judgment by making an eye movement to the appropriate target. We
  studied neurons in LIP that exhibited spatially selective persistent activity
  during delayed saccadic eye movement tasks. These neurons are thought to
  carry high-level signals appropriate for identifying salient visual targets
  and for guiding saccadic eye movements. We arranged the motion discrimination
  task so that one of the choice targets was in the LIP neuron's response field
  (RF) while the other target was positioned well away from the RF. During
  motion viewing, neurons in LIP altered their firing rate in a manner that
  predicted the saccadic eye movement that the monkey would make at the end of
  the trial. The activity thus predicted the monkey's judgment of motion
  direction. This predictive activity began early in the motion-viewing period
  and became increasingly reliable as the monkey viewed the random-dot motion.
  The neural activity predicted the monkey's direction judgment on both easy
  and difficult trials (strong and weak motion), whether or not the judgment
  was correct. In addition, the timing and magnitude of the response was
  affected by the strength of the motion signal in the stimulus. When the
  direction of motion was toward the RF, stronger motion led to larger neural
  responses earlier in the motion-viewing period. When motion was away from the
  RF, stronger motion led to greater suppression of ongoing activity. Thus the
  activity of single neurons in area LIP reflects both the direction of an
  impending gaze shift and the quality of the sensory information that
  instructs such a response. The time course of the neural response suggests
  that LIP accumulates sensory signals relevant to the selection of a target
  for an eye movement.%

    The trial-to-trial response variability of nearby cortical neurons is
  correlated. These correlations may strongly influence population coding
  performance. Numerous studies have shown that correlations can be dynamically
  modified by attention, adaptation, learning, and potent stimulus drive.
  However, the mechanisms that influence correlation strength remain poorly
  understood. Here we test whether correlations are influenced by presenting
  stimuli outside the classical receptive field (RF) of visual neurons, where
  they recruit a normalization signal termed surround suppression. We recorded
  simultaneously the activity of dozens of cells using microelectrode arrays
  implanted in the superficial layers of V1 in anesthetized, paralyzed macaque
  monkeys. We presented annular stimuli that encircled-but did not impinge
  upon-the RFs of the recorded cells. We found that these "extra-classical"
  stimuli reduced correlations in the absence of stimulation of the RF, closely
  resembling the decorrelating effects of stimulating the RFs directly. Our
  results suggest that normalization signals may be an important mechanism for
  modulating correlations. {\textcopyright} 2014 the authors.%

    Visual neurons respond more vigorously to an attended stimulus than an
  unattended one. How the brain prepares for response gain in anticipation of
  that stimulus is not well understood. One prominent proposal is that
  anticipation is characterized by gain-like modulations of spontaneous
  activity similar to gains in stimulus responses. Here we test an alternative
  idea: anticipation is characterized by a mixture of both increases and
  decreases of spontaneous firing rates. Such a strategy would be adaptive as
  it supports a simple linear scheme for disentangling internal, modulatory
  signals from external, sensory inputs. We recorded populations of V4 neurons
  in monkeys performing an attention task, and found that attention states are
  signaled by different mixtures of neurons across the population in the
  presence or absence of a stimulus. Our findings support a move from a
  stimulation-invariant account of anticipation towards a richer view of
  attentional modulation in a diverse neuronal population.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Attention often requires maintaining a stable mental state over time while
  simultaneously improving perceptual sensitivity. These requirements place
  conflicting demands on neural populations, as sensitivity implies a robust
  response to perturbation by incoming stimuli, which is antithetical to
  stability. Functional specialization of cortical areas provides one potential
  mechanism to resolve this conflict. We reasoned that attention signals in
  executive control areas might be highly stable over time, reflecting
  maintenance of the cognitive state, thereby freeing up sensory areas to be
  more sensitive to sensory input (i.e., unstable), which would be reflected by
  more dynamic attention signals in those areas. To test these predictions, we
  simultaneously recorded neural populations in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and
  visual cortical area V4 in rhesus macaque monkeys performing an endogenous
  spatial selective attention task. Using a decoding approach, we found that
  the neural code for attention states in PFC was substantially more stable
  over time compared with the attention code in V4 on a moment-by-moment basis,
  in line with our guiding thesis. Moreover, attention signals in PFC predicted
  the future attention state of V4 better than vice versa, consistent with a
  top-down role for PFC in attention. These results suggest a functional
  specialization of attention mechanisms across cortical areas with a division
  of labor. PFC signals the cognitive state and maintains this state stably
  over time, whereas V4 responds to sensory input in a manner dynamically
  modulated by that cognitive state. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Attention requires
  maintaining a stable mental state while simultaneously improving perceptual
  sensitivity. We hypothesized that these two demands (stability and
  sensitivity) are distributed between prefrontal and visual cortical areas,
  respectively. Specifically, we predicted attention signals in visual cortex
  would be less stable than in prefrontal cortex, and furthermore prefrontal
  cortical signals would predict attention signals in visual cortex in line
  with the hypothesized role of prefrontal cortex in top-down executive
  control. Our results are consistent with suggestions deriving from previous
  work using separate recordings in the two brain areas in different animals
  performing different tasks and represent the first direct evidence in support
  of this hypothesis with simultaneous multiarea recordings within individual
  animals.%

    Visual area V4 in the macaque monkey is a cortical area that is strongly
  involved in color and shape perception. However, fundamental questions about
  V4 are still debated. V4 was initially characterized as a color-processing
  area, but subsequent studies revealed that it contains a diverse complement
  of cells, including those with preference for color, orientation, disparity
  and higher-order feature preferences. This has led to disputes and
  uncertainty about the role of V4 in vision. Using intrinsic signal optical
  imaging methods in awake, behaving monkeys, we found that different feature
  preferences are functionally organized in V4. Optical images revealed that
  regions with preferential response to color were largely separate from
  orientation-selective regions. Our results help to resolve long-standing
  controversies regarding functional diversity and retinotopy in V4 and
  indicate the presence of spatially biased distribution of featural
  representation in V4 in the ventral visual pathway. {\textcopyright} 2010

    We have identified the cortical connections of area MT and determined their
  topographic organization and relationship to myeloarchitectural fields.
  Efferents of MT were examined in seven macaques that had received injections
  of tritiated amino acids, and afferents were examined in one macaque that had
  received injections of two fluorescent dyes. The injection sites formed an
  orderly sequence from the representation of central to that of peripheral
  vision in the upper and lower visual fields. In addition to connections with
  the striate cortex (V1), connections were found between MT and a variety of
  extrastriate areas, including V2, V3, V3A, V4, V4t, VIP, MST, FST, possibly
  PO, and, finally, the frontal eye field. The connections of MT with V1, V2,
  and the dorsal and ventral portions of V3 were topographically organized and
  consistent with the visuotopic arrangement reported previously in these
  areas. V2 could be distinguished from V3 by the distinctive
  myeloarchitectural appearance of the former. Connections with areas V4 and
  V4t also displayed at least a coarse visuotopic organization, in that the
  central representation of MT projected laterally in these areas and the
  peripheral representation projected medially. The lower visual field
  representation of V4 was located dorsally, on the prelunate convexity, while
  the upper field representation was located primarily on the ventral aspect of
  the hemisphere. V4t had a distinctively light myeloarchitecture and received
  projections from only the lower field representation of MT. The remaining
  connections of MT were with areas located entirely in the dorsal half of the
  hemisphere. There were widespread connections with areas MST and FST in the
  superior temporal sulcus, with some evidence for a crude visuotopic
  organization in MST. Connections were also found with area VIP in the
  intraparietal sulcus, with area V3A on the annectent gyrus, possibly with
  area PO in the dorsomedial prestriate cortex, and, finally, with the frontal
  eye field on the anterior bank of the lower limb of the arcuate sulcus. Area
  FST and parts of both MST and VIP had a distinctive myeloarchitecture. The
  pattern of laminar connections with V1, V2, and V3 indicated that MT projects
  “back” to these areas and they project “forward” to MT. That is, the
  projections to these areas from MT terminated in both the supragranular and
  infragranular layers and the projections to MT from these areas originated
  predominantly from cells located above granular layer IV (above layer IVC in
  V1). The pattern of laminar connections with V3A, V4, V4t, and PO was of the
  “intermediate” type in that the projections from MT to these areas were
  spread almost evenly across the layers, including layer IV, and the
  projections to MT originated (in the case of area V4) from cells in both the
  infragranular and supragranular layers. Finally, the pattern of laminar
  connections with MST, FST, and VIP indicated that MT projects “forward”
  to these areas and they project “back” to MT. That is, the projections
  from MT terminated heavily in layer IV in these areas and the projections
  from these areas to MT originated primarily from cells in the infragranular
  layers. The connections of MT indicate that this area plays a major role in
  the relay of visual information from the striate cortex into the parietal
  lobe. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1986 Alan R. Liss, Inc.%

    UNLABELLED Neuronal activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC)
  reflects the structure and cognitive demands of memory-guided sensory
  discrimination tasks. However, we still do not know how neuronal activity
  articulates in network states involved in perceiving, remembering, and
  comparing sensory information during such tasks. Oscillations in local field
  potentials (LFPs) provide fingerprints of such network dynamics. Here, we
  examined LFPs recorded from LPFC of macaques while they compared the
  directions or the speeds of two moving random-dot patterns, S1 and S2,
  separated by a delay. LFP activity in the theta, beta, and gamma bands
  tracked consecutive components of the task. In response to motion stimuli,
  LFP theta and gamma power increased, and beta power decreased, but showed
  only weak motion selectivity. In the delay, LFP beta power modulation
  anticipated the onset of S2 and encoded the task-relevant S1 feature,
  suggesting network dynamics associated with memory maintenance. After S2
  onset the difference between the current stimulus S2 and the remembered S1
  was strongly reflected in broadband LFP activity, with an early
  sensory-related component proportional to stimulus difference and a later
  choice-related component reflecting the behavioral decision buildup. Our
  results demonstrate that individual LFP bands reflect both sensory and
  cognitive processes engaged independently during different stages of the
  task. This activation pattern suggests that during elementary cognitive
  tasks, the prefrontal network transitions dynamically between states and that
  these transitions are characterized by the conjunction of LFP rhythms rather
  than by single LFP bands. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neurons in the brain
  communicate through electrical impulses and coordinate this activity in
  ensembles that pulsate rhythmically, very much like musical instruments in an
  orchestra. These rhythms change with "brain state," from sleep to waking, but
  also signal with different oscillation frequencies rapid changes between
  sensory and cognitive processing. Here, we studied rhythmic electrical
  activity in the monkey prefrontal cortex, an area implicated in working
  memory, decision making, and executive control. Monkeys had to identify and
  remember a visual motion pattern and compare it to a second pattern. We found
  orderly transitions between rhythmic activity where the same frequency
  channels were active in all ongoing prefrontal computations. This supports
  prefrontal circuit dynamics that transitions rapidly between complex rhythmic
  patterns during structured cognitive tasks.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    A landmark study conducted by Berlin and Kay (Basic Color Terms, University
  of California Press, Berkeley, 1969, pp. 1-12) demonstrates that
  well-developed languages contain exactly 11 basic color terms. The basic
  colors (8 chromatic and 3 achromatic) are situated in specific locations of
  color space, suggesting a fixed relationship between specific hue and
  luminance. To determine the physiologic origins of the basic colors, we have
  studied the responses of cells in visual cortical areas V1, V2 and V4 of the
  behaving macaque monkey, using chromatic and achromatic stimuli of varying
  luminance. A total of 569 cells (291 from V1, 205 from V2, 73 from V4) were
  obtained, and classified as 'B' (bright; 43-50{\%} of the total cells in each
  area), 'D' (dark; 6-12{\%} of the total), and 'B/D' (bright/dark; 27-28{\%}
  of the total) color or non-color cells according to each cell's
  color/luminance preference in relation to the neutral gray background. About
  two thirds of 'B' cells in each area were color specific, whereas the
  proportion of color cells in 'B/D' and 'D' categories was lower. In all three
  areas (V1, V2, V4), color cells with preferences for midspectral colors (such
  as yellow, lime and green) also preferred high luminance levels, while color
  cells with preferences for endspectral colors (such as red and blue)
  responded preferentially to luminance levels closer to background. The data
  provide evidence for categorical color perception within the visual system,
  as well as providing a physiological basis for the increased saliency of
  endspectral contours observed at equiluminance in psychophysical studies.%

    Neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT) have been implicated in the
  perception of visual motion, whereas prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons have
  been linked to temporary storage of sensory signals, attentional and
  executive control of behavior. Using a task that placed demands on both sets
  of neurons, we investigated their contribution to working memory for visual
  motion. Monkeys compared the direction of two moving random-dot stimuli,
  sample and test, separated by a brief memory delay. Neurons in both areas
  showed robust direction-selective activity during all phases of the task.
  During the sample, ∼60{\%} of task-related PFC neurons were direction
  selective, and this selectivity emerged 40 ms later than in MT. Unlike MT,
  the PFC responses to sample did not correlate with behavioral choices, but
  their selectivity was modulated by task demands and diminished on error
  trials. Reliable directional signals were found in both areas during the
  memory delay, but these signals were transient rather than sustained by
  neurons of either area. Responses to the test in both areas were modulated by
  the remembered sample direction, decreasing when the test direction matched
  the sample. This decrease arose in the PFC 100 ms later than in MT and was
  predictive of the forthcoming decision. Our data suggest that neurons in the
  two regions are functionally connected and make unique contributions to
  different task components. PFC neurons reflect task-related information about
  visual motion and represent decisions that may be based, in part, on the
  comparison in MT between the remembered sample and test. Copyright
